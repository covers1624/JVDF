# JVDF

A parser for Valve Software's KeyValues ("VDF") format, commonly used by Source engine games, written entirely in Java.

This fork simply moves the project to gradle and provides it over maven [here](https://maven.covers1624.net)

## Features

* Zero dependencies.
* Very fast. The 3MB, 105k line CS:GO item schema was parsed on my machine in about 30ms when HotSpot was warmed up.
* Multi-threaded preprocessor and binder.
* Memory efficient.  The resultant tree structures are often a tenth (1/10) the size of the input text.
* Java object binding (see below).
* Standalone preprocessor can convert human-readable VDF documents into much smaller, valid VDF documents with whitespace and comments stripped.
* Fully compliant with the VDF format, as documented on the [Valve Developer Wiki](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/KeyValues).
* Exposed API is thoroughly unit tested.  The parser was also validated against CS:GO's item schema.

## Example

*VDF document*
```
"key1"      "value1"
"key2"      "value2"
"root_node"
{
    "key3"      "value3"
    ...
    "child_node"
    {
        "child1"        "child value 1"
        "child2"        "child value 2"
    }
}
```

### Using the VDFParser
```
VDFNode node = new VDFParser().parse(...);

node.getString("key1")              => value1
node.getString("key2")              => value2

node.getSubNode("root_node")
    .getString("key3")              => value3

node.getSubNode("root_node")
    .getSubNode("child_node")
    .getString("child2")            => child value 2
```

### Using the VDFBinder

```

class DocumentNode {
    @VDFBindField(keyName = "root_node")
    RootNode root;
    
    @VDFBindField
    String key1;
    
    @VDFBindField
    String key2;
}

class RootNode {
    @VDFBindField
    String key3;
    
    @VDFBindField(keyName = "child_node")
    ChildNode childNode;
}

class ChildNode {
    @VDFBindField
    String child1;
    
    @VDFBindField(keyName = "child2")
    String unrelated;   // note the annotation above binds this to "child2"
}

DocumentNode doc = new DocumentNode();
new VDFBinder(new VDFParser().parse(...)).bindTo(doc);

doc.key2                            => value2
doc.root.key3                       => value3
doc.root.childNode.child1           => child value 1
doc.root.childNode.unrelated        => child value 2
```

> **NOTE:** While the binder is capable of resolving member classes, only member classes that are defined in the same class that they are referenced can be initialized.
